ChestSearch
===========

There is a time in every modded minecrafters life before the ME netowork, before sorting systems, before item ducts, where one must search through many a chest to find a single item. We strive to end that pain. Imagine a day where you can think of an item and any inventory containing it glows with a mystical light, well.... THAT DAY HAS COME.
